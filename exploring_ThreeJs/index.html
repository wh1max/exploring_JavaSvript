        <h2>The 3D Developer's Dream.</h2>

        <p>A front-end developer falls asleep at their desk while working with Three.js. They start dreaming that they're trapped inside a 3D scene they just coded.</p>

        <p>Suddenly, a giant sphere starts rolling toward them! Panicking, they yell, "HELP! Someone fix the physics engine!"</p>
        
        <p>The sphere doesn‚Äôt stop, but just before it crushes them, the developer realizes they can solve this. "Wait...I can just change the position in the code!"</p>
        
        <p>They try shouting out commands:<br>  
        "Sphere.position.x = -100!"</p>
        
        <p>Nothing happens.</p>
        
        <p>"Why isn't it moving?!" they scream. Then it hits them‚Äîthe code is in strict mode. Their last thought is, "I really should‚Äôve enabled debugging..."</p>
        
        <p>They wake up, heart racing, and look at their screen, where a single, mysterious line waits:<br>  
        <code>position: fixed;</code></p>

        <h2> The Front-End Framework Dilemma.</h2>

        <p>A front-end developer walks into a bar. They see two other developers deep in conversation.</p>

        <p>One developer is saying, "I‚Äôm telling you, React is the best! It‚Äôs component-based, fast, and scalable!"</p>
        
        <p>The other one replies, "No way, Vue is where it‚Äôs at! It‚Äôs flexible, simple, and easy to pick up."</p>
        
        <p>The front-end developer grins and says, "You guys are both behind. With Three.js, we can render the entire bar in 3D and walk around it! Why settle for just DOM manipulation?"</p>
        
        <p>The first two developers pause, then the React developer says, "Yeah, but can it handle my 100,000-component app?"</p>
        
        <p>The Three.js developer sighs, ‚ÄúOnly if you‚Äôve got a GPU from the future.‚Äù</p>
